# Minecraft-Bedrock-1.21.121-Mouse-Fix
Since Minecraft Bedrock v1.21.121 the mouse moves out of the Minecraft window when looking around. 
This makes you unable to use your Scroll wheel, Attacking/Placing Blocks and sometimes opening the Escape menu when clicking outside of Minecraft.   
This Program resolves all those issues making the mouse never leave the Minecraft game area.
